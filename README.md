 # The Luck Factor
 Exploring the role of luck in determining success or failure through Agent-Based Modeling.


 ## Example Run

 Below is an example run. The gif may take a few seconds before running. The upper third represents the "upper class", middle third represents the "middle class", and the lower third represents the "lower        class":

 * Changes in capital are determined by luck events (good or bad)
 
 * ## Code
